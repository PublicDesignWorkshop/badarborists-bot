Wesley Rd. and that large sections have been left in roadway at intersection of W. Wesley and Westover.  The only permit I see in system is from June 2009 for a dying maple.  Caller says that tree was in fact removed but that this is a different tree, an oak, which did not seem to by dying.  Two concerns:  1) get tree out of street; 2) take appropriate action if tree removal was not permitted.","Possible Illegal Removal","Closed - Illegal Activity",,
